ðŸŽ¯ Concept of a To-Do List Manager

Definition:
   A To-Do List Manager is a tool that helps users organize and keep track of tasks they need to complete.
It acts like a personal assistant to make sure you don't forget your work, deadlines, or plans.

âœ¨ Main Concepts:
 
Concept	Meaning
Task	A single item you want to do (e.g., "Call the doctor").
Task Status	Whether the task is pending or completed.
Priority	How important the task is (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
Due Date	When the task must be finished.
Categories	Grouping tasks (e.g., Work, Home, Shopping).
CRUD Operations	Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks (basic functions).
User Experience (UX)	The app should be simple, fast, and easy to use.

ðŸ”¥ How it Works (Simple View):

   User adds a new task (writes what they want to do).
   The system stores the task (temporarily or permanently).
   User views the list of tasks (organized by date, priority, etc.).
   User can edit or delete a task if needed.
   User marks tasks as "done" after completing them.
   
ðŸ§  Why it Matters:

   It organizes life and work.
   It boosts productivity by focusing on important tasks.
   It reduces mental clutter (no need to remember everything).
   It tracks progress over time.
   
ðŸ“š Key Principles:

   Simplicity: Easy to use, clean interface.
   Flexibility: Able to add/edit/delete tasks anytime.
